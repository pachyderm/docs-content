# How to View Input Files in Console

1. Authenticate to {{%productName%}} or access Console via [Localhost](http://localhost).
2. Scroll through the project list to find a project you want to view.
3. Select **View Project**.
4. Select a **Repo**.
5. Select an **Inspect Commit** from the slide-out menu. 

The files in your latest commit to the repo are displayed as a table. You can tab through previous commits from the sidebar or input an exact commit ID to filter for the right commit.
