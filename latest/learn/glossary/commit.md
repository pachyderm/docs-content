## About 

In {{% productName %}}, commits snapshot and preserve the state of files and directories in a repository at a point in time.
Unlike Git, {{% productName %}} commits are centralized and transactional. You can create a commit with `pachctl start commit` and save it with `pachctl finish commit`. Once the commit is closed its contents are immutable. Commits may be chained together to represent a sequence of states. 

All commits have an alphanumeric ID, and you can reference a commit with `<repo>@<commitID>`. Each commit has an origin that indicates why it was produced (USER or AUTO).
### Global Commits 

A commit with global scope (global commit) represents the set of all provenance-dependent commits sharing the same ID.

### Sub-Commits

A commit with a more focused scope (sub-commit) represents the "Git-like" record of one commit in a single branch of a repositoryâ€™s file system.
