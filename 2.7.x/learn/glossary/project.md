## About 
In {{% productName %}}, Projects are a scoped boundary full of [input repositories](/{{%release%}}/learn/glossary/input-repo), [pipelines](/{{%release%}}/learn/glossary/pipeline), and the [output repos](/{{%release%}}/learn/glossary/output-repo) associated with pipelines. With [Enterprise](/{{%release%}}/set-up/enterprise/overview/) and [Authentication](/{{%release%}}/set-up/connectors) enabled, Projects also offer [RBAC authorization controls](/{{%release%}}/set-up/authorization/) for users and teams. This means that users can only access the data within a project if they have been granted access to that project.
