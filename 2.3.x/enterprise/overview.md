{{% notice warning %}}

### Additional Features

{{%productName%}} Enterprise unlocks a series of additional administrative and security features needed for enterprise-scale deployments of {{%productName%}}, namely:

- [**Authentication**](../auth/authentication/idp-dex): {{%productName%}} allows for authentication **against any OIDC provider**. Users can authenticate to {{%productName%}} by logging into their favorite Identity Provider. 
- [**Role-Based Access Control - RBAC**](../auth/authorization/): Enterprise-scale deployments require access control.  {{%productName%}} Enterprise Edition gives teams the ability to control access to production pipelines and data.  Administrators can silo data, prevent unintended modifications to production pipelines, and support multiple data scientists or even multiple data science groups by controlling users' access to {{%productName%}} resources.
- [**Enterprise Server**](../auth/enterprise-server/setup/): An organization can have **many {{%productName%}} clusters registered with one single Enterprise Server** that manages the ÃŸEnterprise licensing and the integration with a company's Identity Provider.
- Additionally, you have access to a pachctl command that [pauses (`pachctl enterprise pause`) and unpauses (`pachctl enterprise unpause`) your cluster](../../deploy-manage/manage/backup-restore) for a backup and restore.

### Tooling

{{%productName%}} CE comes with an indispensable complementary tool 
when designing and debugging pipelines: **{{%productName%}} Console**; 
a full Web UI for visualizing pipelines and exploring data. 

While Console is now part of {{%productName%}} Community Edition, 
enabling Enterprise allows you to benefit 
from the full Authentication and Role-Based Access Control capabilities 
by restricting the access to specific resources to authorized users only. 
Unauthorized users will not be able to visualize the content 
of given clusters, repos, and pipelines.
