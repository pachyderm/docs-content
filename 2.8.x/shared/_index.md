As a docs contributor, you can use the markdown files in this folder as embeddings in your documentation. To use them, provide the following `include` shortcode along with the path to the file you want to embed (without the `/latest` prefix or `.md` suffix):

```s
{{% include "path/to/content" %}}
```
