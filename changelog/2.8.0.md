releaseType: minor 
slug: "Pipeline CRUD in Console & More"
fullReleaseNotes: "https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/tag/v2.8.0"
---

- **Feature**: You can now create and manage pipelines in Console! To showcase this, we've added Console steps for all of our [tutorials](/latest/build-dags/tutorials/).
- **Feature**: You can now set [global defaults](/latest/set-up/global-config/) for your cluster that are passed down to all pipeline specs. These defaults provide a consistent experience for your data scientists and help manage your cluster.  You can manage defaults via the PachCTL CLI or within Console.
- **Beta**: You can now try out a beta version of our [Unified Deployment](/latest/set-up/unified-deployment/) experience with Determined. 
- **Update**: [Branch triggers](/latest/build-dags/branch-operations/set-branch-triggers) now require the trigger branch to exist before adding a `--trigger` setting to the target branch.
- **Enhancement**: All [pipeline specification references](/latest/build-dags/pipeline-spec/) have been standardized to use `camelCase` format; use this format going forward when creating pipeline specifications.
