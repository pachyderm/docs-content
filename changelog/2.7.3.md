- **Enhancement**: Refactored the Egress node to display as much of the URL as possible; for a full URL, you can find it in the **Spec** tab.
- **Feature**: A new case for the Node component has been created to display connected projects and repos. These nodes are clickable and will route you to the appropriate resource.
