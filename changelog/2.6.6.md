- **Enhancement**: The DAG view in Console has been refreshed to have a new look and feel. 
- **Refactor**: Cron Triggers have been refactored to perform as expected, where you can set up a scheduled reoccurring event on a repo branch that evaluates and fires the trigger. When a Cron Trigger fires, but no new data has been added, there are no new downstream commits or jobs.
- **Fix**: Fixed an issue in Console for users using Safari where the scrollbar wasn't working as expected.
