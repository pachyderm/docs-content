slug: "Auth Migration and S3 Input Fixes"
fullReleaseNotes: "https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/tag/v2.5.5"
---

- **Fix**: Resolved an issue with "Get File URL" when authentication is enabled by modifying its functionality to operate on file sets instead of commits, leveraging the capability-based authentication of the file set API. 
- **Fix**: Resolved an issue where input files from an s3 were being downloaded by the worker's storage container, causing worker pods to be evicted due to disk pressure. Now, the input files from s3 are not downloaded.
- **Enhancement**: Previously, if a user turned off authentication before upgrading, the `auth_tokens` table would not get migrated. Now, if a user turns off authentication before upgrading, the `auth_tokens` table will still get migrated.
