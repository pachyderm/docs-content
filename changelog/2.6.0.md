## Integrations

- **Enhancement**: The PPS extension has had several improvements, including: a splash screen to help you get started, a label to display your current notebook, and auto-saving fields.
- **Enhancement**: Users can now set the value of `defaultPipelineImage` in two ways: via `<sys-prefix>/share/jupyter/lab/settings/overrides.json`, or by updating the value within the Jupyter UI under **Settings** > **Advanced Settings Editor**. 
- **Fix**: Resolved an issue where using the pipeline view would cause the file browser to disappear.
