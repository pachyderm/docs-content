- **Feature**: [Datum Batching](/latest/prepare-data/datum-batching/) is now available. Datum Batching is a performance optimization process that enables processing multiple datums sequentially. 
- **Feature**: The [JupyterLab Pipeline Extension (PPS Extension)](/latest/integrate/jupyterlab-extension/user-guide/#user-guide-create-a-pipeline) is now available, allowing users to push notebook code directly into a pipeline to create and run it. This feature is in Alpha, so we encourage you to [share your feedback](https://www.pachyderm.com/slack/) with us as you use it.
- **Enhancement**: New RBAC roles have been added to Projects: `ProjectViewerRole`, `ProjectWriterRole`, `ProjectOwnerRole`, and `ProjectCreatorRole`. [You can read about the roles here](/latest/set-up/authorization/permissions/#project-roles).
- **Enhancement**: The Console UI has undergone some substantial improvements, including a revamped file browser and more detailed information about pipeline and job performance.
- **Enhancement**: The Documentation site has undergone a substantial information architecture overhaul, making it easier to find the information you need. Content is now stored in top-level folders that follow the natural progression of learning about and using {{%productName%}}.
