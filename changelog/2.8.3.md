- **Feature**: You can now start, stop, and duplicate pipelines in Console.
  
- **Feature**: You can now set [project defaults](/latest/set-up/global-config/) that are passed down to all pipeline specs within a given project. These defaults provide a consistent experience for your data scientists and help manage your cluster.  You can manage defaults via the PachCTL CLI or within Console.

- **Enhancement**: The "Set Active Project" dialogue in the Console UI has been removed since the action must be performed via the CLI.
