- **Feature**: The preflight check features for 2.7.0 have been backported to 2.6.9. {{%productName%}}'s helm chart now has a section for preflight checks, allowing you to easily validate whether the upgrade/migrations will be successful via a dry run. This section can be found at `pachd.preflightchecks`. Simply set `enabled: true` and set the `image.tag` to the new version you want to upgrade to. If created the pod named `pachyderm-preflight-check` shows a status of `Completed`, you are ready to perform the upgrade. See the [Upgrade steps](/latest/manage/upgrades/#upgrade-1-run-a-preflight-check) for more information.
