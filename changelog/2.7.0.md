- **Enhancement**: Additional PachD Probe settings (`readinessProbe`, `livenessProbe`, and `startupProbe`) have been added to the Helm Chart `values.yaml` file for added flexibility. If not specified, the default values are used. 
- **Enhancement**: General improvements to the upgrade process from 2.4.x > 2.6.5

{{% notice warning %}}

**We do not currently recommend upgrading to 2.6.x at this time.**  If you have questions, please reach out to us on Slack.

Upgrading to 2.6.5 from older versions involves a data migration. This migration can take a long time depending on the size of your cluster. If you are looking to upgrade a long-lived cluster, we recommend waiting for 2.7.0.  For a newer cluster, if you still wish to upgrade, we recommend that you:

- Backup your cluster before upgrading
- Upgrade to 2.6.5 during a time when your cluster is not in use
- Run the following check before upgrading: 
  
  ```s
  pachctl misc test-migrations postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/pachyderm
  ```
